# Advanced E-Learning Platform

## Overview

The Advanced E-Learning Platform is a RESTful API built using Node.js, Express, Sequelize, and JWT authentication. This API supports user interactions, course management, and interactive discussion threads, facilitating a robust e-learning experience.

## Objective

Develop a comprehensive API that allows users, instructors, and admins to interact within the platform. Key functionalities include:

- Course management by instructors
- User details management
- Interactive discussion threads with role-based access control

## Requirements

### Project Initialization and Setup

1. **Framework and Server Setup:**
   - Use Express for server setup, routing, and middleware integration.

2. **ORM and Database Setup:**
   - Implement Sequelize as the ORM to interact with MySQL or PostgreSQL.

### Database Models and Relationships

1. **User Roles:**
   - Implement models for Users, Admins, and Instructors.
   - Use a role attribute in the Users model to manage roles.

2. **User Details:**
   - Create a one-to-one relationship between Users and UserDetails.

3. **Courses and Enrollments:**
   - Allow instructors to manage courses (create, update, delete).
   - Track user registrations with many-to-many relationships.

4. **Discussion Threads:**
   - Threads initiated by instructors within courses.
   - Replies posted by enrolled students.

### Special Rules

- Threads of a course can only be viewed by enrolled students.
- Students can reply to threads.
- Instructors can delete student replies.
- Students can delete their own replies.
- Admins can delete courses.

### JWT Implementation

- Use `jsonwebtoken` for secure token-based authentication.

### Role-Based Access Control

- Middleware to validate user roles.
- Restrict operations based on user roles (e.g., course creation, admin functionalities).

## API Endpoints Design

1. **User Management:**
   - Endpoints for user registration, login, and details management.

2. **Course Management:**
   - CRUD operations for courses.
   - Endpoints for instructors to manage courses and for students to view courses.

3. **Discussion Management:**
   - Create, view, and manage threads and replies.

4. **Special Functions:**
   - Enrolled students can view threads.
   - Students can reply to threads.
   - Instructors can delete student replies.
   - Students can delete their own replies.
   - Admins can delete courses.

5. **Admin Functions:**
   - Modify roles.
   - Delete courses.
   - Alter course enrollments.

## Testing and Documentation

1. **API Testing:**
   - Use Postman to test endpoints for functionality and security.

2. **Documentation:**
   - Detailed `README.md` with setup instructions and endpoint descriptions.
   - Postman export file for API testing.

## Version Control and Submission

1. **Git Usage:**
   - Use Git for version control with meaningful commit messages.

2. **GitHub Repository:**
   - Host the project on GitHub with a well-organized code structure.

## Deployment Considerations

1. **Environment Variables:**
   - Use `.env` files for managing database credentials and JWT secret keys.

2. **Modular Design:**
   - Modular application with clear responsibilities (routes, controllers, models, middleware).

## Define Models

1. **User Model:**
   - `models/User.js`

2. **Admin Model:**
   - Inherits User model with additional privileges.

3. **Instructor Model:**
   - Inherits User model with instructor-specific fields.

4. **User Details Model:**
   - `models/UserDetails.js`

5. **Course Model:**
   - `models/Course.js`

6. **Thread Model:**
   - `models/Thread.js`

7. **Reply Model:**
   - `models/Reply.js`
